Welcome!

This is my responsive web and mobile-friendly
portfolio, built using React JS and Tailwind CSS.

To access the website, navigate to:
https://joannfeng.github.io/

To run the code, make sure you are in the
portfolio directory, then:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

Common Issues:

1. If Github Pages is not rendering the index.html
   and JavaScript correctly: Check that index.html
   is referencing the scripts and styles
   correctly. If using absolute paths, update the
   `vite.config.js` file in the root of the
   project to include the following:
   `base: '/your-repo-name/',`
